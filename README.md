Build and run:
==============

Run the below command to build and execute the code.

```
npm install
npm run exec
```

Usecase:
 - https://github.com/finos/community/discussions/251

High level plan
===============

1. Load the JSON files from the use case into code
2. Write some simple functions to extract some data and print it
3. Write some functions that compare a couple ECS' and print the diff
4. Load up a FDC3 reference  implementation (USE SAIL!)
    -  See https://github.com/finos/FDC3-Sail
5. Create a custom app directly
6. Figure out how to add create an app and make a hello world window
7. Integrate the TC from steps 1-3 and add into the UI
